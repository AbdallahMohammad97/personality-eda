# Personality EDA: Exploring How Introvert & Extrovert Behaviors Connect to Mental Health
Hey, welcome to my project! So I wanted to analyze some real world data about introverts and extroverts and figure out how different personality types maybe act in their daily lives and how that could link to mental health, especially stuff like depression. I found this dataset on Kaggle and honestly, mental health is something I care about, so it seemed like a good idea to explore it while practicing Python and getting better at visualizations.

# Why I Picked This Project
Honestly, I just think it’s interesting how some people want to be alone more and others love being in big groups. I always wondered if those habits make a difference in feeling good or not. Plus, working with this data lets me get hands on with cleaning, plotting, and trying to find some real insights instead of just numbers.

# What I Tried to Figure Out
My main goal was to see if being an introvert or extrovert actually shows up in habits like how much time you spend alone, how many friends you’ve got, how often you go out, or if you get nervous on stage. I wanted to see if any of that connects to the risk of feeling down or getting burned out, and maybe find something useful that could actually help people.

# How I Did It
First I cleaned up the data, there were some missing values and a few numbers that didn’t make sense, so those got sorted out. Then I did some basic exploratory analysis — you know, making charts, comparing averages, and looking for weird outliers. Finally, I tried to connect all the dots and write out some ideas in plain English that hopefully make sense, even if you’re not a data nerd.

# What I Found
It turns out introverts really do spend more time alone, like sometimes 7 or 8 hours a day, while extroverts are more like a couple hours tops. Extroverts also tend to have more friends and go to more events, which kind of lines up with the stereotypes. One thing I thought was interesting: some people feel really drained after socializing but still go out a lot, so maybe there’s some pressure to keep up even when you’re tired.

# A Few Thoughts and Tips
If you’re more introverted, it’s cool to enjoy your own company, but maybe don’t forget to reach out sometimes, even if it’s just to one or two friends. And if you’re an extrovert, it’s fun to be out and about but keep an eye on burnout, nobody can be “on” all the time. No matter what type you are, mental health can sneak up on anyone, so talk to somebody if things feel off.

# How to Run This (Windows and Mac)
First, make sure you have Python 3 installed. If you’re on Windows, grab it from python.org and just make sure to add Python to your PATH when installing. Mac usually has Python 3, but if not, you can use Homebrew and run brew install python.

Next, you want to get this project folder on your computer. You can download the ZIP from GitHub and unzip it, or if you’re comfy with the terminal or command prompt, you can just run git clone and paste the repo link.

Now open your terminal (or Command Prompt if you’re on Windows) and move into the project folder with cd. Then, install the required libraries. On Windows you can do pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn. On Mac you might need to type pip3 instead.

Make sure the personality_dataset.csv file is in the same folder as the code. Then you can open up the .ipynb notebook in Jupyter or VS Code and just run through the cells. Or you can run the .py script straight from the terminal.

If you see any errors, check that you’ve got the right Python and pip versions — just type python --version and pip --version (or python3/pip3 on Mac) to double check.

# Tools I Used
Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
